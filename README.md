# Interactive-Dashboard-Bellybutton-Diversity---Plotly



In this project, I built an interactive dashboard using Plotly to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

# Dashboard design - 

1. a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

2. A bubble chart that displays each sample.

3. Displaying the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

4. Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.

5. A gauge Chart that plots the weekly washing frequency of the individual.
